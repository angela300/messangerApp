This project makes use of React with nodeJS backend and the mongoDB database

To test the App:
Go to the Api folder, open index.js and replace this string with the tsring connection to your MongoDb database:
"mongodb+srv://xxxx:xxxxxxxxx@cluster0.bcqawxn.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

You can check the database design in the 'Models' folder.

Go ahead and run the files. Run the server from the api folder, and the frontend from the root folder
